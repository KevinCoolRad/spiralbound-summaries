    <h1>2-Ingredient Whipping Cream Biscuits</h1>
    <p>Two ingredients. That’s it. Does that even count as a recipe? I don’t know, but these biscuits kind of broke my brain. Biscuits are pretty much my favorite food, so when I came across this super unique recipe, I knew I had to try it.</p>
    <p>Obviously, it’s easy—you just mix together self-rising flour and heavy cream. If you don’t already have self-rising flour on hand, I made a post showing how easy it is to whip some up. But were they good? Yeah! They really were! Absolutely delicious. I kind of wanted to hate them, like it can’t be that easy, right? But it was! And they are lovely! I couldn’t believe it.</p>
    <p>They are dainty and light, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside—everything a great biscuit should be. Definitely not traditional, and I think they would be totally overwhelmed by gravy, but they are perfect for more delicate occasions like tea, or a baby or bridal shower topped with butter and your favorite jam.</p>
    <p>So, thank you so much Pam, for sharing your very special recipe in the vintage Norris Choir community cookbook, and I hope it encourages you to cook more old recipes.</p>
