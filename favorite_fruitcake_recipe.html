    <h1>Vintage Fruitcake Recipe – A Modern Comeback</h1>
    <p>It’s time for fruitcake to make a comeback. Or maybe a rebrand. A glow-up. And it totally deserves one.</p>

    <p>This version is adapted from a 1977 spiral-bound community cookbook — “More Saratoga Secrets Shared.” The original is great, but the ingredients? Well, they needed a refresh. Enter golden raisins, real pistachios, and the finest cherries money can buy.</p>

    <h2>The Fruit Upgrade</h2>
    <p>No more neon candied fruit. If you want a shortcut, the <strong>King Arthur Fruitcake Fruit Blend</strong> is a clean and flavorful option that’s free from artificial colors and packed with dates, currants, and cranberries.</p>

    <p>Want to make your own candied fruit? Do it! You’ll thank yourself.</p>

    <h2>Cherry on Top</h2>
    <p>The best upgrade of all: cherries. Skip the dyed-red jars and splurge on <strong>Luxardo Maraschino Cherries</strong>. They’re bold, rich, and syrupy — the kind of cherry you don’t hide inside a cake, you showcase it.</p>

    <h2>The Recipe</h2>
    <p>Below is the fully modernized version of the original “Favorite Fruitcake.” The method is the same, but the ingredients now reflect today’s cleaner, tastier choices.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Fruitcake</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-1/2 c. chopped candied cherries (I used Luxardo)</li>
      <li>1 c. chopped candied pineapple</li>
      <li>1/2 c. citron, 1/2 c. lemon peel, 1/2 c. orange peel</li>
      <li>1 c. golden raisins</li>
      <li>1 c. chopped pistachios (instead of walnuts)</li>
      <li>1 c. flour (for fruit)</li>
      <li>1 c. butter, 1 c. sugar</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 c. honey (instead of corn syrup)</li>
      <li>1/4 c. orange juice</li>
      <li>1/4 c. Fireball or sherry</li>
      <li>2 c. flour (for batter)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bake at 275°F in greased pans. See times above. Cool completely before removing.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>This cake smells like holiday nostalgia. It’s rich, gooey, and nothing like the dry store-bought bricks of decades past. Give fruitcake another try — it might just become your new holiday tradition.</p>
