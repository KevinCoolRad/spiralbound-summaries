    Looking for a way to use up extra zucchini? This vintage recipe for zucchini patties might be the answer. It’s one of those old-school, crowd-pleasing dishes that works as a light lunch, a side dish, or even an appetizer. It originally came from a community cookbook, which means it’s been tested and loved by many home cooks over the years.

    These patties are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, with fresh zucchini, egg, and onion bound together by breadcrumbs and flour. You can customize them with cheese, herbs, or spices — or leave them as-is for a classic take.
