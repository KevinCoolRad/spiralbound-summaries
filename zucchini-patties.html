    <h1>Vintage Zucchini Patties</h1>
    <p>This is one of those recipes that people always forget exists until they’re faced with a mountain of zucchini in their summer garden and don’t know what to do with it. But let me tell you—these zucchini patties are the reason to grow zucchini in the first place. Crispy on the outside, soft and savory on the inside, and incredibly easy to make.</p>

    <p>Originally published in a 1983 community cookbook from Indiana, this humble recipe combines grated zucchini, onion, egg, and breadcrumbs. It’s very forgiving and easy to customize. Add parmesan if you like, or fresh herbs. You can even make a large batch and freeze them before cooking.</p>

    <p>I made mine with fresh garden zucchini and used a small ice cream scoop to keep the size consistent. Once formed, just fry them in a bit of oil until golden brown. Serve with sour cream, ranch, or even a little marinara for dipping.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever wondered what to do with all that summer squash, this recipe is the one you’ve been looking for. These zucchini patties are proof that simple, vintage recipes are sometimes the very best.</p>
