    <h1>Old-Fashioned Lemon Bars</h1>
    <p><strong>Everyone’s favorite dessert.</strong><br>
    OK, maybe not <em>everyone’s</em> favorite — but who doesn’t love old-fashioned lemon bars?</p>

    <p>A buttery shortbread crust topped with bright, lemony custard. It’s the perfect way to end a picnic in the park. I searched through every vintage community cookbook I own, looking for the best recipe. And, of course, every single one had a version. Interestingly, they were all nearly identical — which means the perfect lemon bar was probably perfected long ago. No surprise there.</p>

    <p>I chose Juanita Bowden’s recipe because she included lemon zest, and since I love my lemon bars extra lemony, hers stood out. And it absolutely delivered. Simple to make and a total crowd-pleaser — Juanita’s lemon bars will never fail. So, let’s get baking!</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Make the shortbread crust</h2>
    <p>Start by creaming the butter in an electric mixer. The original recipe doesn’t give much direction (pretty common in vintage cookbooks), but I’ve found that it’s best to fully cream the butter before adding the powdered sugar. Then whip it a bit more before stirring in the flour.</p>
    <p>The dough will be dry and crumbly — don’t worry, it’s supposed to be.</p>
    <p>Transfer it to a casserole dish and press evenly across the bottom. Bake the crust by itself for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Make the lemon custard</h2>
    <p>While the crust bakes, lightly beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Add lemon juice and zest, stir, then add flour, baking powder, and sugar. Mix everything very well.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Combine and bake again</h2>
    <p>The crust should be lightly golden brown around the edges — no need to fully bake it. Pour the custard over the hot crust and return it to the oven for about 25 minutes.</p>
    <p>Lemon bars baking may just be one of the best smells in the world.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Cool and dust</h2>
    <p>After baking, let the bars cool completely before dusting with powdered sugar. If you dust while it’s hot, the steam will dissolve it — so be patient!</p>

    <p>I’m packing a few bars for my picnic, but I’m definitely snagging a corner piece first. Are you more of a gooey-center person, or do you go for the chewy edges like me?</p>

    <p><strong>Thanks again to Juanita Bowden</strong> for sharing her recipe in her community cookbook so many years ago. I hope this inspires you to treasure vintage spiral-bound cookbooks and keep these incredible recipes alive.</p>
